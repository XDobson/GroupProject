        <h1>New Rhino exhibit coming in March</h1>
        <p>We at BrushWind are happy to announce that we are welcoming a brand new member into our family.
            We have purchased a rare White Rhino from a sanctuary in Zimbabwe, South Africa. Ryan the Rhino was rescued
            as a
            child after his mother was killed by ivory poachers.
            Thanks to our generous donors we are able to welcome Ryan into a home full of staff that will love and care
            for
            him for the rest of his life. We were able to purchase Ryan because of the generous donations of our visitors 
             please visit our donate page <a href="Donate.html">here</a> to find out more </p>

        <h1>Merry-go-Round set to be installed</h1>
        <p>BrushWind will be hosting out first ride. We will be opening a merry-go-round in July near the front of the
            park.<br>
            We listened carefully to customer feedback and decided that a ride would be a great addition to the park.
             The first tickets to the ride will be randomly given out to the first 100 customers that park next week<br> 
            so if you are planning to visit make sure you get here early for a chance to win.<br> We
            are
            excited to hear how you like the new ride and are open to adding more in the future.

        <h1>Memo: Please do not feed the animals</h1>

        <p>We have noticed that some visitors seem to be throwing food into the exhibits.
            Please do not do this are animals are already well feed and human food could make them sick.
             Please do not feed
            the animals any outside food. Thank you for your understanding, We recognize that feeding the animals can be a great and fun activity at our zoo.
             Recently we have installed
             various dispensers around the zoo where certain types of animal feed can be bought. Please note that feeding will only be allowed at certain times.
              When feeding is allowed a green sign will be displayed next to the dispensers Thank you.</p>
