    <h1>New Rhino exhibit coming in March</h1>
    <p>We at BrushWind are happy to announce that we are welcoming a brand new member into our family.<br>
        We have purchased a rare White Rhino from a sanctuary in Zimbabwe, South Africa. Ryan the Rhino was rescued as a
        child after his mother was killed by ivory poachers.<br>
        Thanks to our generous donors we are able to welcome Ryan into a home full of staff that will love and care for
        him for the rest of his life. </p>

    <h1 >Merry-go-Round set to be installed</h1>
    <p>BrushWind will be hosting out first ride. We will be opening a merry-go-round in July near the front of the
        park.<br>
        We listened carefully to customer feedback and decided that a ride would be a great addition to the park. We are
        excited to hear how you like the new ride and are open to adding more in the future.
    </p>
   <a id="Memo"> <h1>Memo: Please do not feed the animals</h1></a>
    <p>We have noticed that some visitors seem to be throwing food into the exhibits.<br>
    Please do not do this are animals are already well feed and human food could make them sick. Please do not feed the animals any outside food<br>
food can be purchased at various kiosks around the zoo. Thank you.</p>
